## PR #455 - Cache plaid balances

### From diegofigueroa
**Category**: Process
**File**: N/A (general PR comment)

> "you need to run the db migrations (`rails db:migrate`) so that the schema.rb file gets updated and the planetscale DRs get created by CI"

**Lesson**: Always run migrations locally before pushing. The schema.rb changes and PlanetScale deploy requests are created by CI based on migration files.

> "We should store as a decimal like we do all of the other fields in our DB. Precision 10 scale 2."

**Lesson**: Financial data should always use decimal type (precision 10, scale 2), not bigint for cents or floats.

## PR #420 - Include transfer volumes in connected account volumes

### From jacksonhuether
**Category**: Architecture
**File**: N/A (general review)

> "Should make it a separate column if you want it to be aggregate of the both. Because there are a lot of places that are using the total_memberships_earnings and expecting it to just be GMV. Also should use ClickHouse for executing the query instead of quering MySQL directly. Also need to add a trigger to invalidate the cache whenever a new transfer is made."

**Lesson**: When adding new metrics that combine existing data, create a new column rather than modifying existing ones. Use ClickHouse for aggregates and ensure cache invalidation on data changes.

> "you don't need this you can just use credit_transactions and filter by credit_type = \"inner_platform_transfer\""

**Lesson**: Before adding new ClickHouse table mirrors, check if existing tables already have the data you need.

**File**: `backend/db/migrate/20260105200000_add_total_earnings_with_transfers_to_bots.rb`

> "Just make this a decimal precision 10 scale 2. also total_earnings_with_transfers_in_usd"

**Lesson**: Column names for USD amounts should have `_in_usd` suffix for clarity.

**File**: `backend/app/workers/backfill_manager/backfill_bot_total_earnings_with_transfers_worker.rb`

> "We should backfill all bots not just child ones. Also i would increase the throttle to 100 per second. And what you can do is enqueue the child ones first so that you can finish this task and then do all the non-child ones below."

**Lesson**: Backfill workers should cover all records, not just a subset. Prioritize the urgent subset first, then handle the rest.

## PR #495 - Zfellows accelerator program

### From g-delmo
**Category**: UX
**File**: N/A (general review)

> "the frontend part of this looks good. since you will have reduced fees, i would add something here on this fee breakdown that shows we are waiving certain fees (or giving you a discount) because you're within your first $500k of revenue thanks to our accelerator program. think about how people will screenshot that and share it as well so imp to make it sexy"

**Lesson**: Think about the marketing/sharing potential of UI elements. Fee breakdowns are screenshot-worthy moments.

### From jacksonhuether
**Category**: Logic
**File**: `backend/app/services/companies/manage_feature.rb`

> "Should add logic to remove fee override once they hit the 500k. Use the handle going paid and check if it has accelerator flag and >500k, then remove fee override if it has one. And then remove accelerator FF."

**Lesson**: Don't forget cleanup logic for temporary states. Accelerator benefits need automatic graduation.

> "Use manage feature service"

**Lesson**: Reuse existing services for feature management rather than creating custom logic.
