## PR #938 - Add rails-console skill for team database queries

### From: sharkey11
**Category**: Architecture
**Intention**: Guide towards established documentation patterns

**Comment**:
> "Hey John! Great content here - this tribal knowledge is super valuable. I pulled this into my PR (#924) with a small restructure to match the pattern we're establishing:
>
> 1. **Model mappings & query patterns** → `internal-docs/engineering/data/schema.mdx` (source of truth)
> 2. **Thin skill wrapper** → `.ai/skills/rails-console/SKILL.md` (points to docs)
>
> The pattern is: internal docs hold the authoritative content, skills are thin wrappers that reference them. This way the content is discoverable both in the wiki and by AI agents.
>
> All your content is preserved - just reorganized. You can close this PR if you're okay with the approach, or let me know if you'd prefer a different structure!"

**Lesson**: When adding new AI skills/documentation, follow the established pattern: authoritative content lives in `internal-docs/`, while skills are thin wrappers that reference those docs. This ensures content is discoverable both in the wiki (for humans) and by AI agents.
