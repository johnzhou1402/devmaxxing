## PRs Worked On (2)

### 🟢 Allow US territories for payout address validation
**Status**: Merged
**What**: Users in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other US territories can now set up payout addresses. Previously they were incorrectly blocked with "must be from the following country: US" even though US territories are valid for US business purposes.
**Next**: Deployed and available in production.

### ⚪ Add custom statement descriptor to create withdrawal API
**Status**: Draft (Approved, needs merge)
**What**: API users can now customize the statement descriptor that appears on recipients' bank statements when processing withdrawals. Added validation for length (5-22 chars) and alphanumeric-only content.
**Next**: PlanetScale deploy requests need approval, then ready to merge.
