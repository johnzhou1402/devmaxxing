## PRs Worked On (6)

### 🟢 Add created_at to payout method API
**Status**: Merged
**What**: API users can now see when payout methods were created, which helps with auditing and debugging payment flows.
**Next**: Deployed and available in production.

### 🟢 Surface MassPay validation errors to users
**Status**: Merged
**What**: Users entering invalid payout information now see specific error messages (e.g., "Invalid bank account number") instead of generic "Failed to store user attributes."
**Next**: Deployed and available in production.

### 🟢 Remove internal fields from public REST API
**Status**: Merged
**What**: Cleaned up the public REST API by removing internal-only fields (withdrawal_type, ledger_account_audit_status) that external developers shouldn't see.
**Next**: Deployed and available in production.

### 🟢 PAY-493: Preserve discounts with remaining uses in ExpireResourceWorker
**Status**: Merged
**What**: Fixed a bug where "once" duration promo codes were being discarded before being applied for billing engine payment users. Users on PayPal/crypto now get their discounts applied correctly after trial ends.
**Next**: Deployed and available in production.

### 🔴 Add rails-console skill for team database queries
**Status**: Closed
**What**: Drafted a shared skill for Rails console database queries to capture tribal knowledge about environments, model mappings, and query patterns.
**Next**: Content was incorporated into @sharkey11's PR #924 with a better structure - internal docs hold the content, skills are thin wrappers.

### 🔴 PAY-494: Add companyId parameter to receipt PDF endpoint
**Status**: Closed
**What**: Started work on allowing merchants to download receipts for their customers' purchases via the API.
**Next**: Needs revisiting - closed without merging.
